# Covid-19 Deaths Data analysis

## Project Overview
The project involves acquiring COVID-19 deaths data from reliable sources, cleaning and preparing the data, setting up an SQL database for efficient storage and retrieval, performing data analysis using SQL queries, and creating interactive visualizations using Tableau.

## Data Sources
For this project, the COVID-19 deaths data can be obtained from reputable sources such as:
- World Health Organization (WHO)
- Johns Hopkins University
- National and local health departments

  
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data cleaning and preparation are crucial steps to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis. This involves:
- Removing duplicate and irrelevant data
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing data formats

## SQL Database Setup
Setting up an SQL database helps organize and manage the data efficiently. Follow these steps:

- Database Creation: Create a new database specifically for this project.
- Tables: Design and create tables to hold the COVID-19 deaths data. Common tables could include 'Countries', 'Dates', and 'Deaths'.
- Data Import: Import cleaned data into the corresponding tables.


## SQL Queries and Analysis
Performing data analysis using SQL queries is a crucial step to extract meaningful insights. Some sample SQL queries could include:
- Total deaths by country and date.
- Average daily deaths over specific time periods.
- Highest mortality rate countries.
- Percentage increase in deaths over time.

## Tableau Visualization

Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that can be used to create interactive and insightful dashboards. Follow these steps:

- **Data Connection:** Connect Tableau to the SQL database where the COVID-19 deaths data is stored.

- **Data Source Setup:** Define relationships between tables if necessary.

- **Dashboard Creation:** Design interactive dashboards that display key insights. Possible visualizations include line charts, bar graphs, heatmaps, and geographical maps.

- **Filters and Parameters:** Implement filters and parameters to allow users to customize their views.

- **Interactive Elements:** Add interactivity through actions, such as highlighting data points or filtering based on user interactions.

## Conclusion

In this project, we successfully analyzed COVID-19 deaths data using SQL and visualized the insights using Tableau. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on mortality rates in various countries over time.
