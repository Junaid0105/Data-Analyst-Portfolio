### Project Objectives:
- Import and clean Amazon sales data to create a structured dataset suitable for analysis.
- Build a data model with appropriate relationships between tables.
- Create insightful visualizations to understand sales performance, trends, and patterns.
- Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit, and growth rates.
- Enable interactive exploration by adding filters and slicers to the report.
- Publish the report to Power BI Service for easy sharing and collaboration.
### Data Sources:
-Amazon Seller Central or other sources with sales data in CSV or Excel format.
### Project Steps:
1. Data Collection and Preparation:

- Identify the required Amazon sales data and export it from the data source.
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

2. Data Loading and Transformation:

- Open Power BI Desktop and load the cleaned data into the tool.
- Apply necessary transformations and data shaping to create a well-organized dataset.

3. Data Modeling:

- Establish relationships between tables (e.g., orders, products, customers) to form a coherent data model.
- Create calculated columns and measures using DAX for deriving meaningful insights.

4. Data Visualization:

- Design a set of visualizations that answer specific business questions and showcase sales performance.
- Use various chart types (Pie charts,Donut chart,Stacked Column chart,Cluster Bar chart, etc.) to display data effectively.
- Use Slicers , cards.

5. Key Metrics and KPIs:

- Calculate key metrics like total revenue, profit margin, average order value, and sales growth.
- Implement time-based calculations to analyze sales trends over time.

6. Interactivity and Exploration:

- Add filters, slicers, and drill-through options to enable users to interactively explore the data.
Provide options for filtering data by product category, date range, and customer segment.

7. Advanced Analysis (Optional):

- Conduct time series analysis to identify seasonality and forecast future sales.
- Utilize advanced DAX functions for complex calculations and custom metrics.

8. Report Publishing and Sharing:

- Publish the completed report to Power BI Service.
- Share the report URL with relevant stakeholders for access and collaboration.

### Resources:
- Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service licenses.
- Amazon sales data from kaggle.
- DAX functions and Power BI documentation.
### Conclusion:
- By completing this project, we aim to provide actionable insights into Amazon sales data, enabling better decision-making and improved sales performance. The interactive Power BI report will facilitate data exploration and collaboration among stakeholders.
